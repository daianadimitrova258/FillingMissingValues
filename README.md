# FillingMissingValues
##### Filling Missing Values is a small application for Univesity project, written in Python and Pandas library.

Its main purpose is to show some ways to cope with missing values in dataset and to make user understand that each data needs different approach. The dataset with which the program works is loaded from csv file, which contains Netflix prices (basic, standard and premium packages) and number of TV Shows, Movies and Total Library in different countries. Of course, there are some missing values in the file.

The code is consist of different functions for every column in the csv file in order to fill them in a way which is most convinient for the certain situtation. 
When the program ends, it writes messages for all data which was NaN and how it was filled (every column is in different color). Something more, it creates a new csv file with processed data.

In the project there is also a documentation, which describes how does the program works, what are pandas functions used for and why. There is also a block schema and information about the types of missing data and ways to cope with each of them.
